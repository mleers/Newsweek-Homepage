This project re-creates the homepage of Newsweek by drawing on several concepts including the bootstrap framework and responsive design.  As the page is resized, certain elements will disappear or be reformatted according to the size of the viewport.  Finishing this project required learning about how boostrap uses a grid system to organize elements.

All images are taken from Newsweek or their sources in order to best clone the webpage.
